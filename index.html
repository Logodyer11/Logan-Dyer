<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->
    
     <div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Field or Career</h1>
    
  <h2>Environmental Engineering is a branch field of engineering concerning itself with the overall protection of people from possible negative environmental effects, as well as creating and developing ways to improve environmental quality in the world around us. Although not an environmental engineer himself, my father was my main inspiration for choosing this overall field of study. I began my internship with his company, Veolia North America, during the summer of 2019, and was prepared for my second rotation this past summer until COVID ceased all hiring. Through modern environmental engineering practices, I've become interested in studying ways to limit fossil fuel usage and create a better tomorrow. </h2>

Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>Family to me are those willing to provide support and love, no matter the circumstances. They have encouraged me to believe in myself and to aim to improve each and every day. Although I consider my immediate family anyone sharing blood relation, because my parents are both divorced and remarried, family to me means more than that. Family to me includes; parents, step-parents, grandparents, step-grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and even some of my closest friends throughout my life.</h2>  
    <h2>Going back to the topic of multiple families, I consider that "Home is where the heart is." Although I grew up in Mechanicsburg, PA, I switched between my parents houses each week and spent time with both of them. As a result, I never considered myself to have one discrete home, but more or less two. Being able to go back and forth has given me the opportunity to expand my career goals and explore jobs in both the Harrisburg and Philadelphia areas, all while being able to live with my parents during the summer months when I am not attending Pitt.</h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

  <h2>Ever since I was a little kid, I was very much involved in extracurricular activities including sports. I've participated in skiing, soccer, basketball, and for a short amount of time, baseball. Growing up, one of my all time favorite movies was The Mighty Ducks. This story follows a group of young "rag tag" hockey players coached by an ex-player sentenced to community service. In the story, the group learns to win and lose as a team and develop the famous motto "Ducks Fly Together." Throughout my life, sports have gone a long way in teaching me the importance of teamwork both on and off the court/field. These skills have become increasingly more valuable as I begin to transition into a career in the field of engineering. Here, several different trained professionals, from varying branches and areas of expertise, are forced to work together to solve a wide range of problems on a daily basis. Without the proper teamwork and communication skills, work is hard to accomplish and could lead to drastic consequences if deadlines are missed.  </h2>

While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>Before heading off to Pitt freshman year, I would have defined my community as the greater Mechanicsburg area. Although not a very large town, it was where I was born and raised and I got to know a great number of people over the years. However, over the past two years in Pittsburgh, I have developed relationships through clubs and academics that have allowed me to broaden that perspective. For example, through Pitt soccer talk, I have begun to meet more people who share my love for soccer. Through AAEES, American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists, this being my first year on the board, I was able to meet upperclassmen and receive advice on the ups and downs in the engineering department. These opportunities have allowed me to see continued success in my time at this University as a result of shared interests, attitudes, and/or goals in life. I believe a community is not fixed, and much like the comment tag, can drift.</h2>

<!--Like it or not, your schooling, formal and informal, for better or for worse, has been another factor that has brought you here and prepared you for this moment. Let's think through these systems, expectations, and outcomes. And let's also think a little about futurity... where is this learning, formal and informal – this unconcealing – taking you? -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">   
  <h2>As stated above, I was born and raised in Mechanicsburg, PA. I graduated from Mechanicsburg Area Senior High School in 2018 and began attending Pitt in the fall. As a freshman engineer at Pitt, you are forced to come in undecided, and you make your department selection following the end of your freshman year. Coming in, I knew I wanted to pursue environmental engineering and my decision was unswayed.</h2> 
        <h2> As an upcoming engineering graduate, I believe some of the best "schooling" can come from on-the-job experience. During the summer of 2019, I worked as an intern at Veolia North America, particularly in the Hazardous Waste division. I was able to receive advice from employees in all lengths of their careers, from recent graduates to higher level managers who had worked their way up in the company. Therefore, it is important to understand that even after graduation, we will continue to learn and develop as we dive deeper into our respective fields of study. </h2>
